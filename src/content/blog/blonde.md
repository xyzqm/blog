To me, *Blonde* feels almost mystical in its melodies, lyrics, and composition. Its variety of rhythms, tunes, and voices represent a deviation from clear-cut storytelling, seen so often with rappers like Kendrick, in favor of depicting fragmented memories, in their often unclear yet highly emotional nature.
In this post, I hope to unpack all these memories and uncover the themes behind Frank Ocean's masterwork, and also to share with you my personal all-time favorite album.

# Key Elements
Before we go through the album track by track, here are some key ideas to keep in mind.

## 1. Dualities

There are three major dualities emphasized in *Blonde*: male/female, day/night, and life/death.

The first one is present even in the album cover/title, as the cover image says "blond," describing a male, while the official album name, *Blonde*, describes a female. The emphasis on this theme makes a lot of sense given Frank's bisexuality.

The day/night and life/death dualities are closely tied to each other and are used mostly to symbolize Frank's mental and emotional state: day Frank is more clear-headed and calculated, while night Frank appears irretrievably lost in love.

## 2. Continuity

*Blonde* is an album that must be listened to as a whole, in order from start to finish. Some important structural properties:

- The beat switch in "Nights" occurs exactly 30 minutes through the hour-long album and divides the album into two parts: the first being day/life, and the second being night/death.
- It's important to note that not all the songs on the album are about the same person! I do believe that many of the songs are about a primary love interest whom we'll call Rose, but it's important to note how the stories of other lovers are interspersed in the first half of the album: indeed, it appears to be precisely every other song in which a secondary love interest is discussed ("Ivy", "Solo", "Self Control"). However, all the songs after "Nights" focus purely on Rose, further contributing to the thematic split between day and night.
- Rose's gender is never specified in any of the songs about them, which makes sense given the male/female duality discussed earlier.

## 3. Voices

Frank employs a variety of voices on the album to symbolize different perspectives, so it's important to pay attention to any pitch shifts or tone changes.


# Tracklist
## Nikes
The first song of the album begins with an unusually pitched-up version of Frank's voice; we'll come back to this when we get into the second half of the song.

Off the bat, Frank describes stereotypes of the "player" lifestyle: materialistic women, drug use, and an unwillingness to settle down. His assertion that "all she want is Nikes / but the real ones / just like you, just like me" is highly ironic in that the life they are living is very clearly fake and lacks any kind of depth or emotion, which he backs up in the following lines: "I don't play, I don't make time / but if you need d--- I got you..." He then mentions A$AP Yam, Pimp C, and Trayvon Martin, three people who came from the same culture Frank is currently describing.

We then get our first short but significant voice change of the album with the line "Woo, fu---- buzzin" delivered in a much higher and scratchy tone than previous lines. The reason for this is clarified in the next line, which returns to Frank's previous tone: "that my lil' cousin, he got a lil' trade."

What I envision for this part is Frank immersed in thought (about Nikes, women, Trayvon Martin etc.) before he hears his "lil' cousin" screaming in the background, which causes his thoughts to shift to his cousin's "lil' trade" as well as girlfriend (whom we'll refer to as "Daisy") who "keeps the scales."

A few lines later, another voice change occurs with the lines "You been holding your breath / weighted down." Many analyses I've seen seem to claim this is still Frank talking, but two lines later ("He don't care for me"), it's clear that this same voice belongs to Daisy. Therefore, my interpretation of these two lines is that Daisy has approached Frank and commented on his glum demeanor, to which he responds in his lower-pitched voice, "punk madre, punk papa." I take this response as a way to deflect Daisy from the true reason for his bad mood: the fact that he no longer wants such a transient, meaningless lifestyle.

Daisy expresses a similar sentiment in her subsequent lines, making the sad observation that "he don't care for me / but he cares for me", implying that their relationship may be purely transactional and lacking any true love. Nonetheless, she seems to be more naive/innocent than Frank because she continues to hope that her relationship will grow into something more. This is an important trait to note, as "Nikes" is not the last time we see Daisy.

With the lines "we'll let you guys prophesy / we gon' see the future first," Frank returns at last to his "normal" voice. These two lines are quite ambiguous, but I take them to mean that his encounter with Daisy had happened in the past and that his normal voice now represents the present, which, relative to the first half of the song, is the "future." The high voice used in the first half then symbolizes a younger, more naive Frank.

Frank then tells us that he's living the fast life "so the last night feels like a past life" and hints at some hurt he experienced between his encounter with Daisy and the present as he says, "don't know what got into people / devil be possessin' homies / demons try to body jump."
