This blog uses Sat Naing's [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme, which I highly recommend if you enjoy concision and simplicity.

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write posts; the only extension I use is [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater), which makes writing the frontmatter for these posts a lot easier (you can find the template I use [here](https://github.com/xyzqm/blog/blob/main/templates/blog.md)).

Some QOL settings to consider for Obsidian:
- Setting the default folder to be your `blog` folder, in conjunction with using `cmd + o` to create new files rather than `cmd + n`, makes for a much smoother startup experience. This option is found in **Settings > Files and Links**.

 - Make sure to disable Wikilinks so your images link properly, as well as to properly set the default location for your new attachments. These options are also under **Files and Links**.

  - I enjoy using vertical/stacked tabs, which you can enable by opening the command palette with `cmd + p` and searching for the command "Toggle stacked tabs." If you use a mouse, remember that you can scroll left/right with `shift + scroll`.

  - I also use Vim mode together with the theme [Shimmering Focus](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus).
